//!
//! Events and event streams for yak.
//!
//! The `Event` enum is the set of events that yak can produce. Events can be produced both during the course of
//! a command or through background operation (such as DICE invalidations of changed files).
//!
//! There are three critical nouns in this data model:
//!  * An **event**, which is a structure representing a point-in-time occurrence, with some additional data.
//!  * A **trace**, which is a collection of events that are to be interpreted as semantically linked. Traces are
//!    globally identified by a trace ID, which is a v4 UUID. Traces are often associated with individual commands,
//!    although they do not have to.
//!  * A **span**, which is a pair of two events that represent a start and stop pair. A span covers a range of time
//!    points. All events are parented to a span that was currently active at the location the event was emitted.
