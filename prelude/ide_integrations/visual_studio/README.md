# VSGO: Visual Studio project generation for yak targets

VSGO is a project generator that generates Visual Studio project and solution
files given yak target labels or patterns, with full functional IntelliSense
and build/run/debug setup.

The majority of heavy lifting is implemented in
[BXL](https://rdeusser.github.io/buck2/docs/bxl/), the extension language of yak, which
offers superb performance and handles incremental changes extremely well.

## Quick Start

Use the project in `examples/vscode` as an example,

```
mkdir modes && echo "" > modes/debug  # One-time setup. Skip if there is one already exists.
python prelude/ide_integrations/visual_studio/vsgo.py root//:main --mode_files modes/debug
```

This will generate project and solution files for the specific target and output
file paths at the end. From there, you can continue with Visual Studio to
browse, edit, and run/debug your yak target.

To list all options and their help docs, run

```
python prelude/ide_integrations/visual_studio/vsgo.py --help
```
